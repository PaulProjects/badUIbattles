some bad User Interfaces

Includes:
- Virtual Keyboard

a changed version of [Virtual-Keyboard](https://github.com/akash435/Virtual-Keyboard)
Tells the user directly what the keys will do

- Enter Age

makes sure the user will first loose interes and then gets forced to enter the age anyways (has to be stopped via cli or process manager)
